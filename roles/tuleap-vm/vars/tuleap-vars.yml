# To edit the encrypted secrets below, you need eyaml installed.
# Familiarize yourself with
# https://puppet.com/blog/encrypt-your-data-using-hiera-eyaml first.
# The edit command goes like this,
#
#   eyaml edit -d \
#     --pkcs7-public-key eyaml/epfl_tuleap_prod.pem \
#     roles/tuleap-namespace/vars/tuleap-vars.yml
#
# ðŸ’¡ This *will not* decrypt anything for you because chances are, you
# don't need to decrypt secrets (YA RLY). For those cases where you
# do, wielding the private key from Keybase is left as an exercise to
# the reader.
