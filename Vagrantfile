    # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
    # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,

    # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
    # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
    # Example for VirtualBox:
    #
    # node.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
    #   vb.gui = true
    #
    #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    #   vb.memory = "1024"
    # end
    #
    # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
    # information on available options.

    # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
    # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
    # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
